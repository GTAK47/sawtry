    Dear Elise aka Lizzard aka Lolilol aka Mrs. LOL,
    If you reached this page you can be proud of yourself, not just passing my second test but completing the internship at Andros as well. I know it was challenging at the most part, fighting against the time and of course your fav annoying co worker.
  </p>

  <p>
    Maybe I did not expressed it that much but I am impressed, you are doing really well in life and I am sure a lot of people would envy you for your lifestyle. Maybe this is a bit weird but your parents did everything right, at the end of the day, they want the best for you and that is reflecting on your behaviour. I barely met someone with your qualities and somehow it makes me sad that we will need go seperate paths.
  </p>

  <p>
    You proved yourself, I have lots of trust in you and you will definitly stay in my mind. Since we are no colleagues anymore and you beat my second game. We can consider us as "friends", if that is really what you want. I bet you feel really special now ... but hey this shit is not over yet, prepare yourself for more incoming games, with every game you will get to know me better, lets see where this will bring us ....
  </p>

  <p>
Nevertheless, I wanna say thank you for the funny time, I enjoyed it a lot, it was quite nice being myself, with all that cringe you had to suffer. I wish you good luck at Kelloggs, let me know how it is. I am looking forward to see you again, stay healthy and clean like always.
</p>

<p>
    Good bye Lizzard, I will miss you ..... maybe

</p>

<p>
  - your Mr. LOL
