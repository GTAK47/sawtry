    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <p>
      Now you know how it works, sometimes things are "boring" at the beginning, am I right? 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hopefully your memories about that night are not gone. Maybe I can help you out. After the gaming session we went to WU, the time there was not to bad I would say. We did our favorite activities, sing, dance and being cringe. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Now it is your turn : I dropped a french song for you, not just one but there was one which I was able to perform somehow haha.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Enter the Birthday from the artist, who made that song.
